	failing on Debian during modules_install.

2019-09-30 03:10  fmhess

	* [r1784] Fix udev rules scripts for agilent usb

2018-12-12 15:43  fmhess

	* [r1783] Generate usb script/rules during "make all" rather

	  user may be running as root.

2018-12-12 15:27  fmhess

	* [r1782] Fixed assignment that was supposed to be a comparison

2018-12-12 14:03  fmhess

	* [r1781] Removed obsolete hotplug usermaps.

	  Fixed problems with usb udev rules not working if the driver
	  module was not already loaded when the hardware was plugged
	  in.

	  Made usb drivers respond to the sysfs device path of their
	  usb interface rather than the parent usb device. This is helpful
	  since the driver binds to the interfaces rather than the device.

2018-12-12 06:25  fmhess

	* [r1780] Update comments in agilent_82357a udev script to use
	  new --serial and --sysfs-device-path gpib_config options.

	  or serial number.

2018-12-10 10:27  fmhess

	* [r1776] Add support for selecting hardware by sysfs device path
	  or serial number. Updated gpib_config docs with
	  missing info on some options. Noted in docs that
	  gpib.conf will be in the sysconfdir, which isn't
	  always /etc/ depending on configuration.

2018-12-10 10:11  fmhess

	* [r1775] Add device ids for various ni adapters to
	  ni_usb_gpib.usermap

2018-12-07 09:12  dpenkler

	* [r1774] Remove dependency on autoconf tools
	  Modify INSTALL instructions
	  Update drivers/gpib/Makefile
	  Add Makefile to invoke kernel build scripts
	  Add version.h to drivers/gpib/include
	  Make definitions of smp_mb__xxx_atomic independent of kernel
	  version
	  Add VERBOSE flag for make, default is VERBOSE=0
	  so that build log is more overseeable.
	  Add HAVE_DEV_OF_NODE workaround for CentOS/RHEL7
	  Fix compile warnings in lpvo

2018-12-06 06:10  fmhess

	* [r1773] Reverted r1766 since it was actually comparing the serial
	  number to the device tree path. Linux doesn't seem to
	  have a universal (for all bus types) way of specifying
	  a piece of hardware by path, so we can't use the
	  device tree path to specify a usb device anyways.

2018-12-05 11:19  dpenkler

	* [r1772] Apply gpib_lines patch from Tomislav Ivek

2018-11-29 08:29  dpenkler

	* [r1769] Add compat fixes for kernels < 3.15 and 3.16

2018-11-28 14:36  dpenkler

	* [r1768] Add patch from Tomislav Ivek

	  The current linux-gpib Python class can run into a double-close
	  situation. This bug is related to a design point in Gpib.Gpib
	  which
	  cleans up its GPIB handle only on Python's GC cycle. This is not
	  guaranteed to run when the programmer expects it to and in
	  extreme
	  cases might even leak resources. This is resolved by adding a
	  Gpib.close() method for user-controlled cleanup.

2018-11-28 10:26  fmhess

	* [r1767] Applied patch from Derek Kozel <derek.kozel@gmail.com>:

	  During the linux-gpib-kernel make install process the kernel
	  modules_install command is run bit the DESTDIR argument is not
	  passed
	  in meaning that it will always try to install to the system
	  directory
	  rather than a custom directory. Adding
	  INSTALL_MOD_PATH="$(DESTDIR)" to
	  the command correctly passes the information.

2018-11-16 20:30  fmhess

	* [r1766] Applied patch from Manuel Mommertz
	  manuel.mommertz@desy.de to
	  permit selection of ni usb gpib adapter by device path.

2018-11-15 18:08  dpenkler

	* [r1765] add dependency on perl/Makefile.PL to force build

2018-11-07 19:09  fmhess

	* [r1764] Makefile.PL is generated from Makefile.PL.in now.
	  Also, use abs_top_srcdir/abs_top_builddir instead
	  of hard coding dir paths.

2018-11-07 18:05  dpenkler

	* [r1762] Commit for 4.2.0

	  compat/include/linux/timer.h compatibility header.

2018-05-08 18:05  fmhess

	* [r1751] Added compatibility header for linux/sched/signal.h
	  header

2018-05-08 17:50  fmhess

	* [r1750] Patch from Stefan.Mahr@zyxel.eu :
	  There's a timer initialisation bug in ni_usb driver, especially
	  for NI_USB_B. The timer is setup after first use of mod_timer
	  (ni_usb_b_read_serial_number->usb_send_bulk_msg), so kernel
	  throws a
	  bug in timer.c: BUG_ON(!timer->function);

2018-04-14 21:56  fmhess

	* [r1749] Renamed "device_files" target to "device_files_install"
	  and
	  made it respect DESTDIR.

2018-04-12 22:46  fmhess

	* [r1748] Don't mknod device files, or add "gpib" group during
	  "make install". Add instructions to INSTALL for performing
	  these tasks.

	* [r1747] Added DESTDIR support for some files installed into
	  sysconfdir.

	  not using our bootstrap script.

2018-04-12 00:45  fmhess

	* [r1743] Fix some bugs in make install when srcdir != builddir

2018-04-11 01:52  fmhess

	* [r1742] Move some headers into include/gpib/ and stop
	  generating symbolic links for them.

2018-04-11 01:13  fmhess

	* [r1741] Fix some compilation issues when srcdir != builddir.
	  Perl binding still broken in this case.

2018-04-11 00:16  fmhess

	* [r1740] Replace AC_CHECK_FILE with AS_IF, since AC_CHECK_FILE
	  fails when cross-compiling.

2018-04-10 19:57  fmhess

	* [r1739] Copyed license file into linux-gpib-kernel

2018-04-09 19:41  fmhess

	  linux-gpib-user.

2018-04-09 19:35  fmhess

	* [r1737] Added compat_device_create.h header so we can compile
	  without
	  the compat/include/linux headers.

2018-04-09 19:02  fmhess

	* [r1736] Fix include of drivers/gpib/include through use
	  of subdir-ccflags-y

2018-04-09 18:55  fmhess

	* [r1735] Re-added util/linux_flags/Makefile which somehow got
	  dropped when splitting out kernel modules to separate
	  directory.

2018-04-09 18:53  fmhess

	* [r1734] Moved compatibility headers to compat directory.

2018-04-05 01:59  fmhess

	* [r1731] First pass at splitting kernel modules from the
	  user-space stuff.

2018-03-16 21:27  fmhess

	* [r1730] Use fmh_gpib_core extra status bits to handle releasing
	  rfd_holdoff, instead of using the generic nec7210 function.

2018-03-07 22:24  fmhess

	* [r1729] Don't spuriously set RECEIVED_END_BN after clearing it.

2018-03-06 21:24  fmhess

	* [r1728] Tweak waits during accel read/write. Use new end and rfd
	  status
	  bits in interrupt handler to keep track of board state more
	  easily. Use RFD holdoff ASAP to try and maintain holdoff
	  after reads that don't see an END.

2018-02-12 20:54  fmhess

	* [r1727] Make fmh_gpib_dma_write() wait for last byte to be
	  transferred
	  over the GPIB bus, rather than just be transferred into the
	  chip.

2018-02-02 18:05  fmhess

2018-01-19 18:42  fmhess

	* [r1721] Undo changes to existing ioctl behavior introduced in
	  r1695.

	  functions into gpib_board_config_t.

	* [r1705] Fix interface name for accelerated interface.

2017-12-28 00:57  fmhess

	  waits on async io completion.

2017-10-13 23:58  fmhess

	* [r1666] Don't take control asynchronously on a routine basis.
	  It is dangerous to do so due to the omission of the T10 delay.
	  This will unfortunately lead to timeouts when a talker
	  leaves a data byte sitting on the bus with noone reading
	  it, but that is unavoidable.

2016-12-23 12:48:15 dpenkler

	* [r1653]  Attempt to fix NI-USB-HS slowness when using ibwait
	- Protected read and write with separate mutex which
	  is checked in line-status. Issue is that line status
	  is called in ibwait which can destroy addressing setup
	  that might be in effect for ibrd/ibwrt from another thread.
	  Normally status monitoring interrupts are setup
	  on attach and should not need to be re-enabled.
	  Here we commented out the code in soft_update_status.

	* [r1522] drivers/gpib/sys/osinit.c: Patch from Ken McIvor
	  <mcivor@iit.edu>:
	  
	  We've heard via a Debian bug report that the module-init-tools
	  authors
	  are pushing to eliminate as many files as possible from `/etc/
	  modprobe.d':
	  
	  http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=518241
	  
	  The attached patch uses the MODULE_ALIAS_CHARDEV_MAJOR() macro to
	  establish a built-in alias to the gpib_common module, as per
	  their
	  recommendation. I've tested it against Debian "sid" without the
	  `/etc/
	  modprobe.d/gpib' file and everything appears to work fine.

	  * __doc__ strings for every function (modeled on the ones Keith
	  had written)
	  * a few function names made less terse:
	  cmd->command
	  tmo->timeout
	  trg->trigger
	  * integer constants for IbaXXXX and IbcXXXX added to the module
	  * all functions--that don't have something else useful to
	  return--return
	  ibsta, just like the C versions
	  * the read() function now puts its result directly into the
	  Python output
	  string, with /no copying/ from a C string to a Python string.
	  This should
	  improve efficiency of large and/or frequent reads.

	  board type, which uses dma for writes but not for reads.

2006-06-13 02:09  fmhess

	* [r1384] driver/eastwood/eastwood_gpib.c: Make absolutely sure END

	* [r1301] driver/ines/ines_init.c, driver/ines/ines_read.c,
	  driver/ines/ines_write.c: Avoid use of INES_AUX_CLR_IN_FIFO and
	  INES_AUX_CLR_OUT_FIFO as they
	  seem to be buggy. Bad behaviour where first byte written would
	  have EOI asserted when acting as device has been fixed by this
	  change.

2005-10-17 00:56  fmhess

	* [r1300] examples/ibtest.c: show results of timed out reads

2005-10-16 21:56  fmhess

	* [r1297] driver/include/Makefile.am, driver/include/nec7210.h,
	  driver/include/nec7210_registers.h: split nec7210_registers.h out

	  roucaries bastien <roucaries.bastien@gmail.com>

2005-10-16 21:51  fmhess

	  Added support for returning errors from
	  gpib_interface_t::enable_eos
	  for the case of the Agilent 82357a which can't do 7 bit eos
	  compares. Added support for querying support of 7 bit compares
	  through
	  ibask() (option = Iba7BitEOS). This breaks binary compatibility
	  between the lib and kernel, since the board_info_ioctl_t has
	  gotten
	  a new member.

2005-10-16 17:29  fmhess

	* [r1295] driver/agilent_82357a/agilent_82357a.c,

	  Fixed problems in agilent_82357a driver where more important
	  operations could fail
	  due to the board being busy in update_status or line_status. Made
	  everything block on mutex except update_status and line_status
	  (which
	  are likely to be called hopelessly when an async io operation is
	  in
	  progress). update_status and line_status try nonblocking lock of
	  mutex
	  and return immeditately on error.

2005-10-10 20:45  fmhess

	* [r1294] driver/sys/ibread.c, driver/sys/ibwrite.c,
	  test/Makefile.am, test/README, test/libgpib_test.c, test/runtest:
	  Changed libgpib_test to synchronize through stdin/stdout. Fixed

2005-10-10 20:30  fmhess

	* [r1293] driver/ines/ines_read.c, driver/ines/interrupt.c: Fixed

2005-10-10 15:01  fmhess

	* [r1292] AUTHORS, TODO, driver/include/gpib_types.h,
	  driver/sys/osfuncs.c, lib/ibOnl.c: don't require board mutex to

2005-02-09 19:52  fmhess

	* [r1190] driver/agilent_82350b/agilent_82350b.h,
	  driver/agilent_82350b/agilent_82350b_init.c,
	  driver/agilent_82350b/agilent_82350b_write.c: fifo is actually

	  CLRSC
	  backwards (the tnt5002 manual is wrong). I don't know why this
	  change seemed to fix my nec7210 atgpib board a few weeks ago, but
	  the
	  nec7210 based board is working fine now with CLRSC=2 and SETSC=3
	  (and
	  it displays the same problem with not being able to set the REN
	  line
	  if you use SETSC=2 and CLRSC=2)..

	  than underscore for sed 's' command delimiter
